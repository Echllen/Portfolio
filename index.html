        <h2>Hi, I'm Ellen</h2>
        <p>I'm 26 years old and live in Linköping, Sweden.
          At the moment, I'm writing my thesis in Business Administration whilst working
          at an office in Linköping. I have a lot of hobbies that all have the
          common denominator <em>creativity</em>. I also have the skill of watching too
          many TV-series (and quoting them constantly). I get the greatest satisfaction
          when I find a gif that perfectly captures the emotion that I wanna display.

          <br><br>With the help of my dad, I designed my first web page when
          I was about eight years old. After that, I joined everyone else in the
          big blog-hype and had several blogs for different purposes. What I liked most
          was the styling and playing around with the HTML and CSS, which is why I created
          so many different ones. Sadly, I didn't realise that that was a potential career
          path until recently, which is why I'm now trying to catch up by completing several
        courses in both programming and web design.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 3px">I currently work with business service at DB Schenker in Linköping.
        During this time, I've worked closely with our customers (both consignors and recipients) in customer service, our
        hauliers as an administrator and of course with my co-workers at the terminal and the office.
        I've also worked a lot in office environments such as Teams, Compass and Excel.

        <p style="margin-top: 3px">I worked part time in retail at Capi AB, Arlanda Airport's only tech-store. I learnt how to sell,
        handle (often <em>stressed</em>) customers and to do inventory. I also worked during uncomfortable hours, and often
      opened or closed the store. </p>

        My main work task was greeting our customers and taking their payments after their visit. Since it was Vapiano, I did not
      serve our customers, but I cleaned up after them, and made sure that the tables where clean and inviting.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 3px">Working at a preschool was a great experience where I learnt how to motivate kids and develop my skills in patience and teaching.
          I learnt a lot from my co-workers; not only how to be a teacher, but also how to be a good colleague and how to find joy in what you do, and having fun at the workplace.
